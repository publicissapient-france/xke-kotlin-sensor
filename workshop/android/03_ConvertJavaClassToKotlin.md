# My first Kotlin class

1. Open `MainActivity.java`
2. Open `Action and option` dialog box: `CMD` + `SHIFT` + `A`
3. Type `Convert Java File to Kotlin File`

Well done! You have your first Kotlin class :horse:

If you haven't yet launch application then do it: `CTRL` + `R`
Application can run on your [personal Android device](http://www.greenbot.com/article/2457986/how-to-enable-developer-options-on-your-android-phone-or-tablet.html) or on [Genymotion](https://www.genymotion.com/).

When the application runs go to next step: [Add a TextView to the Activity](04_Add_TextView.md).
